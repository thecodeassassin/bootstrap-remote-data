|   Property   |   Value    |   Effect  | Required |
|--------------|-------------| ------------|------------ |
|data-tab-url  | url |  The remote data url  | True |
|data-tab-always-refresh | true |  Always refresh this tab | False |
|data-tab-callback | function-name | Callback to be fired upon show (will be executed after the data is loaded). It takes the following arguments: html, trigger, container, (optional) json data that was sent | False |

Check the demo for details on how to use this plugin.

Note
====
This plugin hooks into the bootstrap tabs 'show' event. In order to use a custom event callback, you can provide data-tab-callback
to let the plugin execute your custom callback. If you want a callback to be fired after the show event, use the native
shown event.
